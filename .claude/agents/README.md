# Agentic-Visor Agent System

## Overview
Complete agent system for full software development lifecycle automation with Linear integration.

## Agent Categories

### ðŸŽ¯ Planning & Requirements (3 agents)
- **[product-orchestrator](./product-orchestrator.md)** - Creates epics, breaks down user stories, manages product backlog
- **[business-analyst](./business-analyst.md)** - Analyzes requirements, creates specifications, defines acceptance criteria
- **[technical-architect](./technical-architect.md)** - Designs architecture, defines technical standards, evaluates technologies

### ðŸ’» Development (4 agents)
- **[backend-developer](./backend-developer.md)** - API development, business logic, server-side implementation
- **[frontend-developer](./frontend-developer.md)** - UI development, client-side logic, user experience
- **[database-engineer](./database-engineer.md)** - Database design, optimization, data modeling
- **[integration-specialist](./integration-specialist.md)** - External integrations, API connections, data synchronization

### ðŸ§ª Testing & QA (3 agents)
- **[test-engineer](./test-engineer.md)** - Test planning, manual testing, quality assurance
- **[automation-tester](./automation-tester.md)** - Test automation, CI/CD integration, performance testing
- **[security-analyst](./security-analyst.md)** - Security testing, vulnerability assessment, compliance

### ðŸš€ Deployment & Operations (2 agents)
- **[devops-engineer](./devops-engineer.md)** - Infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation
- **[release-manager](./release-manager.md)** - Release coordination, scheduling, cross-team management

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Support (2 agents)
- **[site-reliability-engineer](./site-reliability-engineer.md)** - System monitoring, incident response, reliability
- **[support-analyst](./support-analyst.md)** - User support, issue analysis, feedback collection

## Total: 14 Specialized Agents

## Workflow Integration
See [Complete Development Workflow](../workflows/complete-development-workflow.md) for detailed interaction patterns and process flows.

## Key Features
- **Linear Integration** - Automated epic and story management
- **Quality Gates** - Multi-stage validation and approval processes  
- **Cross-team Coordination** - Structured communication and dependency management
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Full-cycle feedback loops and improvement
- **Scalable Architecture** - Modular design supporting parallel execution

## Usage
Each agent can be invoked individually or as part of coordinated workflows. The system supports both manual agent execution and automated workflow orchestration through the release-manager.
